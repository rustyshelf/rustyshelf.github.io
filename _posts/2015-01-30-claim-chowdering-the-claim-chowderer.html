<p>Today: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2015/01/29/itunes-connect-developer-issue/" target="_blank">Apple releases a bug that logs developers into other people's accounts</a>.</p>
<p>As a user of it, I can tell you definitively that iTunes Connect is still a buggy mess. These days it’s a very pretty mess though. To me that's more telling than anything else. Apple chose to make the interface look good, before it fixed all the bugs.</p>
<p>So I raise my glass to you John, enjoy the chowder.</p>
