<html><body>
<p>Swift (-taylor) is the exciting new language Apple debuted at WWDC in 2014. It took pretty much all of us in the developer community by surprise. We're now in August, 5 beta builds into Xcode and I feel like I've started to form an opinion about the language itself.</p>
<p>First the good parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks a million times cleaner than Objective-C code</li>
<li>I won't miss the [square brackets]</li>
<li>It's much nicer to read</li>
<li>It has a lot of modern ideas and influences that make it a joy to write</li>
<li>It's apparently fast, and only <a href="http://www.jessesquires.com/apples-to-apples-part-two/" target="_blank">getting faster</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's where, for me, it ends. You see Apple sold me on the promise that this would solve my number one gripe about Objective-C: memory management issues. I had assumed my number two gripe, proper stack traces on crashes, was joining us for the ride. If you want to feel some of the pain that comes with Objective-C development, feel free to peruse this crash, from an older version of Pocket Casts:</p>

<p>Looks very detailed right? So as an app developer you get that back, and now it's your job to figure out why. The first thing you look for is your app's line numbers, so you can follow the execution path. Our app executable is called 'podcasts' and we can see it's in main.m, line 14. Now most Objective-C developers have already skipped ahead and know where this is going, but indulge me. Here's line 14:</p>
<pre>return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass([SJAppDelegate class]));</pre>
<p>Oh...it's the line our app was launched from, and doesn't really bare any resemblance to where the crash actually started from. What button did the user press? Which screen where they on? There's no way to know. Now before you email me, I know exactly why it's like that. I've put up with it for many years. Currently in Swift, those stack traces are even worse. I won't post one until they actually release it to be fair to Apple...but why oh why when they were making a 'modern' programming language could they not solve this? I know, the Objective-C runtime is hailed by many the world over as being fast, and awesome. But it's 2014, the things I actually care about are the problems Microsoft and Sun Microsystems solved, memory management and reliability. If it comes at the expense of a tiny amount of speed, I'll happily take it. I can count the amount of times on no hands that my code was running slow, and it was the languages fault. That goes for Java, Objective-C, C#, C++, Ruby and so many other languages. Don't get me wrong, I love more speed, but give me more reliability first.</p>
<p>Update: Someone on Twitter wanted to be clever and pick apart the actual stack trace I posted. It was an example kids. But here's a more specific one:</p>

<p>I know the cause of this. I forgot to call removeObserver somewhere. But where? Damned if I know unless I give every single one of my methods unique names. Pointers are fun. My point is, a language/framework/runtime combination that is modern, should remove that guesswork.</p>
<p>As much as people hate Java, and to some extent I'm in that camp too, here's an equivalent crash from our Android app:</p>

<p>Yes I know, ha ha Null Pointer, Java, LOL. But that's an exact line number friends. What did the user do? They tapped the subscribe button. Which page where they on? The Podcast Dialog. Zero ambiguity. Guess how many of our Android crashes we get that for? 100%. In iOS we'd be lucky if even 30% of our crashes had stack traces we can line up to actual things we can then reproduce. So most iOS crashes today involve me becoming House MD and poking the code for hours, only to figure out that like always, it's never Lupus.</p>
<p>I haven't even covered the crashes I've seen where Objective-C was sending a message to the wrong object, a classic sign that the object you thought you had has been released and you're now talking to something completely different. I'm assuming that Swift, running on the same runtime, with the same compiler, is going to have that exact same issue. I also haven't gone into how the entire Cocoa/Cocoa Touch API is built for Objective-C and is still at times awkward to interact with in Swift. That one at least feels like mostly a transitional issue. So count me disappointed until the day Apple announce a new runtime that actually gets rid of memory related crashes, and gives us accurate stack traces. Until that day, old man Rusty is just going to keep yelling "get off my lawn, kiddo's".</p>
