<p>Remember in December of 2014 when some crazy punk told you that <a href="http://rustyshelf.org/2014/12/17/2015-the-year-of-android/">2015 would be the year of Android</a>? Well he's not looking so crazy now, and I think he'llÂ continue to look less and less crazy as the months tick by.</p>
<p>Today iA Writer joins the Android fold:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the summer of 2014, we started dabbling with the Android SDK to get a feeling of what it would mean to develop an Android adaptation of iA Writer. We discovered a dev-friendly world with scant traces of the Android horror stories we had in the backs of our minds.</p>

<p>Well worth a read. The post does a good job of highlighting the differences (both positive and negative) of developing for Android vs iOS.</p>
