<blockquote><p>Now Google plans to up the ante at its app store: It will also move from a 70/30 split to 85/15 for subscriptions — but instead of requiring developers to hook a subscriber for 12 months before offering the better split, it will make it available right away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to be outdone, Google <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/6/8/11889298/google-apple-subscription-app-revenue-share" target="_blank">has their own 85/15 deal</a> for subscriptions, but doesn't require you to wait a year. Interesting. Can we please continue this competition until the revenue split for paid apps is also 85/15? No? Come on, a developer can dream...</p>
