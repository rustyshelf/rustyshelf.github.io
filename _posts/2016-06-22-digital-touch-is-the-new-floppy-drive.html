<p>Will your car always have wheels? If we agree it won't, then why don't we remove them now? This argument makes literally no sense. Neither the lightning port nor bluetooth are superiorÂ replacements for the standard headphone connector. Then again this is from the guy who brought us this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2015/04/09/sweet16/" target="_blank">unforgettable gem</a>. What a revelation that digital touch on the Apple Watch turned out to be, bringing 16 year olds together the world over.</p>
<p>I literally can't wait for my Twitter stream to be filled with "What's the big deal, just buy an adapter" tweets come September.</p>
