<p>Shipping is hard. So hard that sometimes I like to make joke websites about it. My personal favourite would have to be <a href="http://www.hasbjangoreleasedskala.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hasbjangoreleasedskala.com/</a>, for my friend Marc, who I honestly believe will ship the most amazing design app we've ever seen. Just not today, well let me refresh, yep, not today. A close second was the one I made for my co-founder Philip, when he said he was feeling a bit de-motivated. That's how <a href="http://www.shipthatfuckingthing.com/" target="_blank">this site</a> was born. It's half Silicon Valley joke, half long running office gag, but I still go there from time to time to have a laugh.</p>
<p>But today, today we actually shipped a real thing. Pocket Casts 5.0 for Android. An amazing effort spanning many months of development, with some truly awesome design and features.
