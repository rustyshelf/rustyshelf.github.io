<p>I'm still catching up on all things work and decompressing after spending 15 days in the US for Google I/O and WWDC. In place of some blog posts, I thought I'd throw out a few other places you can hear me talk about recent events.</p>
<p>First up there's our Google Play Developer video which was a blast to be involved in:<br />

<p>I was recently on <a href="http://www.designdetails.fm/32/" target="_blank">episode 32</a> and <a href="http://www.designdetails.fm/33/" target="_blank">episode 33</a> of the Design Details podcast (<a href="http://pca.st/designdetails" target="_blank">Pocket Casts link</a>). We chatted about Google I/O, WWDC and some weird designer stuff I've never heard of ;)</p>
<p>I was of course on <a href="http://topical.fm/13" target="_blank">episode 13</a> and <a href="http://topical.fm/14" target="_blank">episode 14</a> of Topical (<a href="http://pca.st//topical" target="_blank">Pocket Casts link</a>). Again we chatted about Google I/O and WWDC. Episode 14 though was more dear to my heart, it was all about Internet Fame.</p>
<p>I got to be on <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/all-about-android/episodes/216?autostart=false" target="_blank">All About Android</a> and try out my American accent. I think Ron loved it.</p>
<p>Chris Lacy of Action Launcher fame also invited me on his aptly name 'The Blerg' podcast to chat about, you guessed it, <a href="http://chrismlacy.podbean.com/e/ep-2-wwdc-15-with-russell-ivanovic/" target="_blank">WWDC</a>. (<a href="http://pca.st/blerg" target="_blank">Pocket Casts link</a>)</p>
<p>If you love short podcasts, then my appearance on <a href="http://inthirty.net/2015/06/inthirty-182-shifty-jelly-visits-moscone-west/" target="_blank">inThirty</a> is for you. You'll never guess how long it goes for.</p>
<p>If that's not enough Rusty in your life, then honestly, you probably need some therapy. Either that or you need to watch <a href="https://twitter.com/crafty/status/609302673435836416/photo/1">this gif</a> on repeat.</p>
