<p>I haven't updated this site in a bit, which I know will greatly upset the 3 people that read it and have just now realised they haven't seen my posts in a while! Anyway thought I'd try something new and post a few things too small for a blog on Twitter instead. My motivation in doing so was to try and encourage the people who follow me (and have the means) to consider going electric with their next car. I know that in the communities and forums I'm in everything I'm saying is common knowledge, but I wonder if the general public know some of this?</p>
<p>Firstly a thread about going downhill: [this used to be a link to Twitter, but now it’s gone].</p>

<p>Then about the thing people ask about most, charging: [this used to be a link to Twitter, but now it’s gone].</p>

<p>That said I feel like I have to give the people actually reading my blog something a bit extra, so here's a recent picture I took of my car in the Adelaide Hills. What's that? You don't care? How dare you!</p>
