<p>It will probably come as no surprise that I'm a huge fan of podcasts. The main reason that Pocket Casts exists today was so that Philip and I could have an app to listen to them.</p>
<p>Ever since I switched to Android last year though, there has been a huge hole in my podcasting life. On the Apple side of things you can take your pick of great shows that cover both Apple news, and Apple topics. On the Android side the news side is really well covered by shows like <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/all-about-android" target="_blank">All About Android</a> and <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/podcast" target="_blank">Android Central</a>. The technical programming side of things is too, by one of my favourite podcasts, <a href="http://fragmentedpodcast.com" target="_blank">Fragmented</a>.A deeper topic based show though? Not so much.</p>
<p>Until today.</p>
<p>Friends, Americans, countrymen lend me your ears. No really, and quite literally. Let me introduce you to Material, the Google podcast I've always wanted:</p>
<p><a href="http://relay.fm/material" target="_blank"><img style="border:1px solid #000000;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2015/07/material.png" alt="Material" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p><a href="http://relay.fm/material" target="_blank">Material</a> is a weekly discussion about the Google and Android universe. Every week, we try to answer the question, “What holds up the digital world?” The answer, so far, is that it’s Google all the way down. The show is intended for people like me. It's also intended for those who use iOS devices, even exclusively. We're not here to beat the Google drum or make you switch, just to give you a perspective on what the other side looks like.</p>
<p>I keep saying we? Who is joining me in this crazy endeavour? None other than <a href="https://twitter.com/ihnatko" target="_blank">Andy Ihnatko</a>, beloved tech pundit and <a href="https://twitter.com/yasmineevjen" target="_blank">Yasmine Evjen</a>, passionate designer and Android user. Also the fine folk at <a href="http://relay.fm" target="_blank">Relay FM</a> have welcomed us to their network. It's so exciting to have such a great home for our podcast and to get to do it with two amazing co-hosts.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, come and join us.</p>
