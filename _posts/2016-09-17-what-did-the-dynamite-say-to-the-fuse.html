<p>A little over a year ago I decided that it was a bit odd that I'd never experienced the other side of podcasting. I helped build Pocket Casts, an amazing app for listening to podcasts that's available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4We" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts" target="_blank">Android</a> and even <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/" target="_blank">the web</a>. I had also made guest appearances on quite a few podcasts for interviews and commentary. But I'd never actually edited a podcast, seen one submitted to iTunes or experienced the regular week in, week out life that podcasters all over the world live.</p>
<p>I don't remember exactly how it came about, but somehow <a href="http://twitter.com/jellybeansoup" target="_blank">Jelly</a> and I got together and decided we wanted to try to make a podcast together. I had met Jelly previously at a conference in Melbourne, and he had me once or twice on the <a href="http://mobilecouch.co/" target="_blank">Mobile Couch</a> podcast. Long story short Topical was born. Our original idea was that we'd each take opposing sides on a topic, and debate it for no more than 30 minutes. For whatever reason Topical turned into another kind of show altogether, with <a href="http://topical.fm/4" target="_blank">episode 4</a> probably being the closest we ever got to that vision. I learnt how to edit a podcast, what goes into publishing a podcast and all sorts of things about microphones, background noise and sound proofing.</p>
<p>It was a great ride, I still remember how much fun it was to record things like <a href="http://topical.fm/3" target="_blank">Shower Thoughts</a>. Or the time we unveiled <a href="http://topical.fm/10" target="_blank">Myke Hurley's killing spree</a>. Casey Liss joined us to talk <a href="http://topical.fm/20" target="_blank">emotions</a>. Wendy Zukerman (who has the best voice in podcasting, bar none) talked <a href="http://topical.fm/26" target="_blank">Science Journalism</a> with us. But as with every ride, it had to come to an end one day. In true Topical fashion the episode aptly named 'The End' wasn't the end, the <a href="http://topical.fm/80" target="_blank">Epilogue</a> was. It's worth staying right to the end of that one to see what transpires in the future for Topical.</p>
<p>So to anyone that ever listened to our fun experiment, I thank you. I had a blast doing it and I think we ended on a high note. Also if you're reading this in the future and robots have indeed taken all our jobs, please don't tell Jelly, I can't bare the indignity of him being right about that one.</p>
