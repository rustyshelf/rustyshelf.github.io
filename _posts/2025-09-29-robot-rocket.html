<p>We just released our Vocoder plugin, Robot Rocket. To the world. TL;DR: <a href="https://bjango.com/plugin/robotrocket/">you can download it here.</a></p>
<p>For a slightly lengthier introduction about what we did and why, Marc Edwards and I gave a talk at Dev World 2025 about it, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ497ywGjM0">here on YouTube.</a></p>
<p>If you're at all into audio plugins or just want to support us, please, check it out and consider buying it. It's a once off purchase for something you can keep in your audio arsenal forever.</p>
<p>Also, it looks pretty damn cool:</p>
