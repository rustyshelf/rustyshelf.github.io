<p>In the Year of Our Lord‚Ñ¢ 2025, I finally moved my blog off of WordPress. It's now on GitHub Pages. I'm sure you're just as excited about that as I am!</p>
<p>Now, to answer your super important questions!</p>
<h3>Does this mean you'll be blogging again?</h3>
<p>Dunno.</p>
<h3>What was it like to not post for 2 years?!</h3>
<p>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<h3>Did you just put an emoji into a blog post? What are you, 50?</h3>
<p>Not yet!</p>
<h3>What happened to your very chique and definitely not out of date theme?</h3>
<p>Yeah that's gone. I'm still learning all about the world of Jekyll Themes and am very, very lost. Maybe one day this site will look good? Maybe you're reading this in 2027 and laughing. Who knows. Life is a mystery wrapped in a taco.</p>
