<blockquote><p>You’re 16. You’re in school. You’re sitting in class. You have a crush on another student — you’ve fallen hard. You can’t stop thinking about them. You suspect the feelings are mutual — but you don’t know. You’re afraid to just come right out and ask, verbally — afraid of the crushing weight of rejection. But you both wear an Apple Watch. So you take a flyer and send a few taps. And you wait. Nothing in response. Dammit. Why are you so stupid? Whoa — a few taps are sent in return, along with a hand-drawn smiley face. You send more taps. You receive more taps back. This is it. You send your heartbeat. It is racing, thumping. Your crush sends their heartbeat back.</p>
<p>You’re flirting. Not through words. Not through speech. Physically flirting, by touch. And you’re not even in the same classroom. Maybe you don’t even go to the same school.</p>

So you take a flyer and...no wait...you have no idea what their iMessage ID is or how to contact them. There's also the fact that neither of you have an Apple Watch, because they are so damn expensive. You go back to day dreaming about becoming a Youtube star, at which point you'll be able to buy both of you a watch! Then they'll surely give you their iMessage ID! Then you can send them some taps! "Yeah that's right I tapped them so hard" is what you'll tell your...</p>
<p>...your dreaming is rudely interrupted by your teacher. She's asking you for an answer to a question you're almost certain you didn't hear. Is this real life? Everybody is laughing at you.</p></blockquote>
