<p>Episode 1 of Topical is out (links: <a href="http://topical.fm/" target="_blank">web</a>, <a href="http://pca.st/VflQ" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a>). This brings our total to 2, because hey, we're programmers and that's how we roll.</p>
<p>Our plan is to release a new episode once a week, on Friday. If you're in America that's probably Thursday for you, because you don't live in the future like we do. It's ironic, after explaining in episode 0 about how we weren't just going to be talking about tech that we did, but rest assured the next episode is something else entirely.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we can make a show that doesn't attract partisan support. We want Apple people, Google people...and hey...even People people! Whether we get there or not is anyones guess. In the meantime it's been fun <a href="https://twitter.com/jayohms/status/576392811932684288" target="_blank">reading</a> the <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdadswell/status/576414697081167873" target="_blank">various</a> feedback we've <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/3/13/are-you-getting-it" target="_blank">received</a> so <a href="https://twitter.com/thatMrDom/status/576276820850446336" target="_blank">far</a>.</p>
