<p>Some of my friends have odd names, but none so odd as <a href="http://jellystyle.com/" target="_blank">Daniel 'Jelly' Farrelly</a>. I mean 'Daniel'...seriously!</p>
<p>If you're into odd names, and you're into podcasts, Jelly and I just happened to have startedÂ one. Just for you. Well not really for you, but feel free to pretend it is.</p>
<p>Chances are if you made it to this 3rd paragraph, you might actually like it, so check it out!</p>
