<p>As harsh as this article sounds in places, it's a fascinating read. I agree with almost all of it. You can bet that it's causing all sorts of private discussions among developers around the world. I seriously doubt you'll see those discussions happening much in the open though. They'll be confined to Twitter DMs, iMessages and private Slack channels. It's one of those odd instances where if you don't see this article widely distributed, you'll know it hit a bit too close to home.</p>
