<p>Have you ever wondered about how Google Photos emerged from Google+? What are the aims of the Google Photos team for the future? What are some core philosophies of the people driving the product?</p>
<p>We had the privilege of interviewing John Nack and Aravind Krishnaswamy from the Google Photos team this week on Material. If you don't recognise those names, you really should. John is the Google Photos Product Manager and Aravind the Engineering Manager. Even more interestingly John used to be the Product Manager of Photoshop and Aravind a Senior Technologist also at Adobe. Everyone I've met that knows both of these guys said they were amazing to work with.</p>
<p>It's really interesting to me that both have gravitated towards Google Photos and that Aravind found his way there from Google+. If you want to hear more about them, you really owe it to yourself to listen to <a href="http://relay.fm/material/11">this weeks episode</a>.</p>
<p>One final thing that struck me: how they talk about being intimidated by joining Google. These two highly accomplished individuals are just as intimidated as you or I when they start a new job surrounded by people who seem smarter than they are. Food for thought.</p>
